# Website Layout

Here, we will describe the layout of the website and try to:

1. Log any dependencies.
2. Log any automations already built.
3. Log any manual quick how-tos.

## Organization

Our website is built to support the following heirarchy:
> Home -> {{ `RESEARCH DIRECTION`}} 
The `RESEARCH DIRECTION` can then be split further into `TOPICS` if need be:
> Home -> {{ `RESEARCH DIRECTION`}} -> {{ `TOPICS` }}


Note, we currently have 4 main `RESEARCH DIRECTION` with some having `TOPICS`: 
- Temporal Graph Learning
    - Temporal Graph Benchmark
    - Temporal Graph Applications
- Crime & Online Markets
- Politics & Online Media
    - Information Integrity
    - Ideology & Polarization
    - Social Simulations
- Toxicity & Online Games
