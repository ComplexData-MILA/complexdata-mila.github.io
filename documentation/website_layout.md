# Website Layout

Here, we will describe the layout of the website and try to:

1. Log any dependencies.
2. Log any automations already built.
3. Log any manual quick how-tos.

## Organization

Our website is built to support the following heirarchy:
> Home -> {{ `RESEARCH DIRECTION`}} 

Note, we currently have 4 main `RESEARCH DIRECTION`: 
- Temporal Graph Learning
- Crime & Online Markets
- Politics & Online Media
- Toxicity & Online Games


Visit [Research Direction Layout](./research_direction_layout.md) for the layout pages for research direction.
Visit [Topic Layout](./topic_layout.md) for the layout of the topic direction.
Visit [How To](./how_to.md) for frequent how-to / customization done on-top of minimial-mistakes.
