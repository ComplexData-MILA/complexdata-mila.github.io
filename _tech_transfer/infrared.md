The Infrared project is looking to turn 6+ years of rigorous research into real-world impact. Our algorithms have been combined to create a searchable, AI-powered database that provides human trafficking survivors with access to their digital footprint and that of their trafficker. This digital footprint sheds light on where the victim has been, over what time period, and to which other victims they might be connected. The footprint is checked for common indicators of human trafficking, which is designed to corroborate and empower victims' stories.

Using the Infrared tool, human trafficking survivors will be armed with new types of high quality evidence, reducing the burden and trauma of re-sharing their stories. Furthermore, the product is designed to enhance the survivor's chances of success in accessing restorative justice (by way of criminal courts, civil courts, family courts, refugee tribunals and other venues where evidence is needed).

We are looking to collaborate with non-profit organizations working with human trafficking survivors to enhance the quality of care and the opportunities they have to rebuild their lives.
