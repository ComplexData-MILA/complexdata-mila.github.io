This project combines large language models (LLMs) with web search APIs to create an AI-powered fact-checking tool. The goal is to develop a publicly accessible app that empowers individuals to verify the accuracy of information they encounter online. This app goes beyond fact-checking and aims to enhance the understanding of its users by offering credible sources.

Designed to be user-friendly and transparent, the app ensures that users can see the reasoning and evidence behind its conclusions. This combination of AI-powered analysis and credible source linking aims to build trust in the tool while addressing the growing challenges of misinformation and disinformation
