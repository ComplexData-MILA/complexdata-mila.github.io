Sex trafficking impacts 4.8 million people globally and is a $99 billion USD industry that often operates undetected, including in Canada. Technology has become a critical tool for traffickers, enabling recruitment and exploitation while making these crimes harder to trace. However, innovative analytics can uncover hidden patterns, identify victims, and provide much-needed support to those impacted. Our interdisciplinary team of AI and criminology experts is dedicated to developing context-aware, human-centered solutions to tackle this issue responsibly. Through advanced techniques like data mining and anomaly detection, we are working to bring a data-driven approach to the fight against human trafficking in Canada.
