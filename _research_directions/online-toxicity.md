    excerpt: "Toxic and harmful speech online is more than just unpleasant; it has widespread social and economic repercussions, particularly as it permeates social media and gaming platforms. In gaming, where toxicity affects 75% of young players, this behavior harms mental health, alienates communities, and even reduces player engagement and spending, which impacts the industry’s bottom line. Beyond financial losses, unchecked toxicity risks fostering real-world violence and inciting harmful social behaviors. Despite advances in detection methods, including AI-driven moderation, the ever-evolving nature of toxic language poses significant challenges to companies and communities alike. Addressing this problem isn’t just about improving user experience—it’s essential for maintaining safe, inclusive, and healthy online spaces."
