    excerpt: "Partisanship has increasingly become a major point of contention in public discourse online, and as a result, researchers have developed a variety of methods to evaluate the party affiliations of users on social media. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of party prediction tools and propose new methods that are comparable or improve upon existing works."

    excerpt: "Digital space has become a battleground for partisan debate, threatening the cohesion of societies by facilitating political polarization. In this work, we develop a method for measuring polarization over time using the party affiliations of, and interactions between, social media users, using the 2020 U.S. presidential election as a case study.

    excerpt: "While LLMs have demonstrated how effective they can be for tasks in the English language, such as detecting social media usersâ€™ political ideology, their performance in other languages remains understudied. We contribute to this area of research by fine-tuning smaller LLMs to identify hyperpartisans in Persian social media, and compare the results to those from open-source and commercial models."

    excerpt: "The COVID-19 pandemic sparked rigorous debate about public health measures online, as the timing and extent of interventions unfolded.

Our research on ideology and polarization explores how digital platforms amplify partisan divides and shape political discourse across societal contexts. It focuses on understanding the expression, measurement, and impact of ideological differences in shaping public opinion, both within and across linguistic and cultural boundaries. This area highlights the interplay between technology, political behavior, and societal cohesion in an increasingly interconnected world.
