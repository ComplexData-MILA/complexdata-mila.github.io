one-liner: How can we prototype effective defenses to attacks on information integrity in an ethical and efficient way?
excerpt: We use and develop state-of-the-art approaches to human social system simulation to simulate attacks on information integrity in critical social phenomena and to prototype effective defenses against them.

The pernicious effects of digital manipulation campaigns can reverberate through entire societies, but effectively detecting and responding to them is a challenge. Testing solutions in real-world contexts is highly complex and poses ethical barriers. Taking advantage of state-of-the-art approaches to modelling human social systems with face validity, in this project we overcome these barriers using a simulation approach. We have developed a scalable digital social environment simulator that offers fine-grained experimental control through precise and versatile configuration and a suite of evaluation analyses. We are using it to study information integrity in the context of societal events where it plays a central role, such as elections. By simulating real world and future manipulation strategies and analyzing their properties, we are pursuing a quantitative approach to prototyping effective defenses against them.
