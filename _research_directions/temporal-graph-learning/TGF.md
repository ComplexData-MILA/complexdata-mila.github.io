    excerpt: "Temporal graph foundation models represent a paradigm shift in network science, combining the dynamic expressiveness of temporal graphs with the power of large-scale pre-training to enable sophisticated network understanding and prediction. This emerging field bridges traditional graph learning with modern foundation model approaches, while its integration with LLMs and multi-modal capabilities promises to unlock new frontiers in temporal network analysis."
