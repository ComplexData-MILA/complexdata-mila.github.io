    excerpt: "Temporal graphs provide powerful frameworks for modeling and analyzing real-world systems that evolve over time. In the realm of anomaly detection, these dynamic structures enable us to identify unusual patterns and critical changes in evolving networks, from financial transactions to social interactions. Similarly, in epidemic modeling, temporal graphs capture the crucial time-varying nature of human contact networks and transportation systems, allowing for more accurate predictions of disease spread compared to traditional static network approaches."
