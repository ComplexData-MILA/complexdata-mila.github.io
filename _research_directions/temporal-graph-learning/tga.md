Temporal graphs provide a robust framework for modeling and analyzing systems that evolve over time, offering unique advantages in addressing dynamic real-world challenges. In anomaly detection, they capture time-varying patterns to identify irregularities across domains such as finance, social networks, and cryptocurrency markets. For example, temporal graphs can highlight fraudulent transactions, uncover outliers in trading patterns, or detect sudden shifts in network behavior. In epidemic modeling, temporal graphs accurately represent evolving human contact networks, enabling more precise predictions of disease spread by accounting for temporal dependencies and behavioral changes, such as social distancing or vaccination. They also enhance forecasting in transportation systems like flight networks, tracking delays, cancellations, and disruptions over time to optimize scheduling and reduce congestion. By incorporating both structural and temporal dynamics, temporal graphs empower more realistic, data-driven approaches to solving complex, time-sensitive problems across diverse fields.
