# # To get started: Copy this template profile below and start editing.
# Role: ["Faculty", "Staff", "Collaborator", "Student", "Outside"]
#  ** Faculty -> set any title, should be Professor, Assistant Professor, Post-Doc
#  ** Staff -> set any title, can be intern / external hires, 
#  ** Collaborator -> set any title ( will not be shown on people page)
#  ** Student ->PhD, Master, Undergrad

#  auto_update_publications: can only be set to true if current_role type is faculty, staft, student and semantic scholar id is provided
#  (we can just set this by ourselves)

## If we change the schema, we have to update the following:
## _data/authors.yml
## _includes/author-profile.html
## _includes/card-authors-with-role.html
## _includes/display-author.html
## .github/issue_template/add-update-member.yml
## src/python/add_update_member.py

## Questions:
## Is there data schema for .yml files?

## Add / Update member (top-level & current role)
## Update member - change current_role to past_role
## Update member - update past_role

## Automations to do:
## auto update data schema
##   e.g. (research_directions to be pulled directionly from _research_directions)
## auto update .github issue templates?
##   e.g. (research_directions to be pulled directionly from _research_directions)
##   e.g. split add / update member into two issues
##        * update member -> issue_template automatically adds member in dropdown. 
##        * can't change the name (as it is the id)
##   e.g. split add / update publication
##        * update publication --> dropdown list to get publication (put id + paper name)
##        * ==> cannot update publication id manually
## auto check dependencies
## once finalized, add templates for
##  -- add / updating research_directions
##  -- add / updating sub-research-directions

## TODO:
# Add an update documentation folder?

## Research Directions

## team_members:
## grab from authors.yml
## auto-hide (past members?)

## For highlights, manual:
  ## Higlighted publications / news
  ## provide the id? 
  ## image, overlay
  ## title
  ## caption
  ## order

## Publications
## automatic scraping from semantic (do we want to change the layout?)
## author on the side (?)
## do we want to underline users from our lab & link to each author?

## News 
## In the media / event
## Custom pages, blog, curated
