excerpt: In this paper, we introduce a significant enhancement to the standard SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) epidemiological model by integrating dynamic flight networks to better capture the mobility of populations, particularly in the context of disease spread like COVID-19. The authors propose a modified model called Flight-SEIR, which accounts for the movement of individuals through air travel, thereby estimating imported cases based on air traffic volume and test positive rates. This modification allows for more accurate modeling of disease transmission between populations, enabling early detection of outbreaks, more precise estimation of the reproduction number, and better evaluation of the impact of travel restrictions. By incorporating real-world flight data, Flight-SEIR provides a more realistic and comprehensive approach to epidemiological modeling, crucial for navigating pandemics in an interconnected world.

## Abstract

Current efforts of modelling COVID-19 are often based on the standard compartmental models such as SEIR and their variations. As pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases can spread the disease between populations through travel, it is important to incorporate mobility between populations into the epidemiological modelling. In this work, we propose to modify the commonly-used SEIR model to account for the dynamic flight network, by estimating the imported cases based on the air traffic volume as well as the test positive rate at the source. This modification, called Flight-SEIR, can potentially enable 1). early detection of outbreaks due to imported pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, 2). more accurate estimation of the reproduction number and 3). evaluation of the impact of travel restrictions and the implications of lifting these measures. The proposed Flight-SEIR is essential in navigating through this pandemic and the next ones, given how interconnected our world has become.
