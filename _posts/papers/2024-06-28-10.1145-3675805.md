excerpt: "While game companies are addressing the call to reduce toxicity and promote player health, the need to understand toxicity trends across time is important. With a reliable toxicity detection model (average precision of 0.95), we apply our model to eight monthsâ€™ worth of in-game chat data, offering visual insights into toxicity trends for Rainbow Six Siege and For Honor, two games developed by Ubisoft. Ultimately, this study serves as a foundation for future research in creating more inclusive and enjoyable online gaming experiences."

## Abstract

The advent of online spaces, particularly social media platforms and video games, has brought forth a significant challenge: the detection and mitigation of toxic and harmful speech. This issue is not only pervasive but also detrimental to the overall user experience. In this study, we leverage small language models to reliably detect toxicity, achieving an average precision of 0.95. Analyzing eight months of chat data from two Ubisoft games, we uncover patterns and trends in toxic behavior. The insights derived from our research will contribute to the development of healthier online communities and inform preventive measures against toxicity.
