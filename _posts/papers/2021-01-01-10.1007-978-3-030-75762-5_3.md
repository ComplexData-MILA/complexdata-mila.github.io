excerpt: SigTran is an efficient graph-based method for identifying illicit nodes in blockchain networks. SigTran constructs a graph from blockchain transaction records, representing nodes based on their structural and transactional characteristics to differentiate between legitimate and illicit activities. This method is versatile and can be applied to various blockchain networks.

## Abstract

Cryptocurrency networks have evolved into multi-billion-dollar havens for a variety of disputable financial activities, including phishing, ponzi schemes, money-laundering, and ransomware. In this paper, we propose an efficient graph-based method, SigTran, for detecting illicit nodes on blockchain networks. SigTran first generates a graph based on the transaction records from blockchain. It then represents the nodes based on their structural and transactional characteristics. These node representations accurately differentiate nodes involved in illicit activities. SigTran is generic and can be applied to records extracted from different networks. SigTran achieves an F_1 score of 0.92 on Bitcoin and 0.94 on Ethereum, which outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks obtained by much more complex, platform-dependent models.
