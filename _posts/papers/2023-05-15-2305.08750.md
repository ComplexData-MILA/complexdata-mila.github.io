excerpt: We introduce a novel spectral method called Scalable Change Point Detection (SCPD) to address the limitations of current solutions in detecting anomalous change points in dynamic graphs. SCPD generates an embedding for each graph snapshot by efficiently approximating the distribution of the Laplacian spectrum, and it can capture shifts in node attributes by tracking correlations between attributes and eigenvectors. Through extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data, the authors demonstrate that SCPD achieves state-of-the-art performance, is significantly faster than existing methods, can handle large quantities of node attributes, additions, or deletions, and effectively discovers interesting events in large real-world graphs

## Abstract

How can we detect traffic disturbances from international flight transportation logs or changes to collaboration dynamics in academic networks? These problems can be formulated as detecting anomalous change points in a dynamic graph. Current solutions do not scale well to large real-world graphs, lack robustness to large amounts of node additions/deletions, and overlook changes in node attributes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel spectral method: Scalable Change Point Detection (SCPD). SCPD generates an embedding for each graph snapshot by efficiently approximating the distribution of the Laplacian spectrum at each step. SCPD can also capture shifts in node attributes by tracking correlations between attributes and eigenvectors. Through extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data, we show that SCPD (a) achieves state-of-the art performance, (b) is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods and can easily process millions of edges in a few CPU minutes, (c) can effectively tackle a large quantity of node attributes, additions or deletions and (d) discovers interesting events in large real-world graphs.
