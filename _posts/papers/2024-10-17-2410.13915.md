excerpt: "In this paper, we present a multi-agent simulator based on Deepmind's Concordia, a software library for LLM-based multi-agent simulations of real world human experience. Our unique contribution is the addition of an online social media environment component as well as agent persona generation from measured psychological trait survey data. We demonstrate the simulator by simulating a 100-agent town election under different manipulation conditions. Through longitudinal surveys, we show via our custom dashboard the effects of manipulation in altering the outcome of elections."

## Abstract

The rise of AI-driven manipulation poses significant risks to societal trust and democratic processes. Yet, studying these effects in real-world settings at scale is ethically and logistically impractical, highlighting a need for simulation tools that can model these dynamics in controlled settings to enable experimentation with possible defenses. We present a simulation environment designed to address this. We elaborate upon the Concordia framework that simulates offline, `real life' activity by adding online interactions to the simulation through social media with the integration of a Mastodon server. We improve simulation efficiency and information flow, and add a set of measurement tools, particularly longitudinal surveys. We demonstrate the simulator with a tailored example in which we track agents' political positions and show how partisan manipulation of agents can affect election results.
