excerpt: In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), a comprehensive collection of large-scale, diverse datasets designed for the realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation of machine learning models on temporal graphs. These datasets span multiple years and domains, including social, trade, transaction, and transportation networks, and encompass both node and edge-level prediction tasks. The research highlights significant variability in the performance of common models across different datasets and demonstrates that simple methods often outperform existing temporal graph models in dynamic node property prediction tasks. Additionally, TGB provides an automated machine learning pipeline for data loading, experiment setup, and performance evaluation, fostering reproducible and accessible research.

## Abstract

We present the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation of machine learning models on temporal graphs. TGB datasets are of large scale, spanning years in duration, incorporate both node and edge-level prediction tasks and cover a diverse set of domains including social, trade, transaction, and transportation networks. For both tasks, we design evaluation protocols based on realistic use-cases. We extensively benchmark each dataset and find that the performance of common models can vary drastically across datasets. In addition, on dynamic node property prediction tasks, we show that simple methods often achieve superior performance compared to existing temporal graph models. We believe that these findings open up opportunities for future research on temporal graphs. Finally, TGB provides an automated machine learning pipeline for reproducible and accessible temporal graph research, including data loading, experiment setup and performance evaluation. TGB will be maintained and updated on a regular basis and welcomes community feedback. TGB datasets, data loaders, example codes, evaluation setup, and leaderboards are publicly available at https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/.
