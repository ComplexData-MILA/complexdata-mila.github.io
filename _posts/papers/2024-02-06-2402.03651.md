excerpt: Here we introduce TGX, a Python package specifically designed for the analysis of temporal networks, addressing a gap in existing software libraries that primarily focus on static graphs. TGX provides an automated pipeline for data loading, processing, and analysis of evolving graphs, making it a robust tool for examining the features of temporal graphs. It includes functionalities for data processing, such as discretization of temporal graphs and node sub-sampling, and offers a variety of measures for network analysis, including average node degree and the evolving number of nodes and edges per timestamp. Additionally, TGX supports numerous temporal graph visualization plots and statistics out of the box, making it useful for studying social networks, citation networks, and tracking user interactions.

## Abstract

Real-world networks, with their evolving relations, are best captured as temporal graphs. However, existing software libraries are largely designed for static graphs where the dynamic nature of temporal graphs is ignored. Bridging this gap, we introduce TGX, a Python package specially designed for analysis of temporal networks that encompasses an automated pipeline for data loading, data processing, and analysis of evolving graphs. TGX provides access to eleven built-in datasets and eight external Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) datasets as well as any novel datasets in the .csv format. Beyond data loading, TGX facilitates data processing functionalities such as discretization of temporal graphs and node sub-sampling to accelerate working with larger datasets. For comprehensive investigation, TGX offers network analysis by providing a diverse set of measures, including average node degree and the evolving number of nodes and edges per timestamp. Additionally, the package consolidates meaningful visualization plots indicating the evolution of temporal patterns, such as Temporal Edge Appearance (TEA) and Temporal Edge Traffic (TET) plots. The TGX package is a robust tool for examining the features of temporal graphs and can be used in various areas like studying social networks, citation networks, and tracking user interactions. We plan to continuously support and update TGX based on community feedback. TGX is publicly available on: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/TGX.
